## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

About me: I am a hobby coder with a minor in Computer Programming. I am an artist hoping to become a concept artists in the entertainemt industry.

Skills: I enjoy Python, HTML, and CSS. I hope to make a video game some day in the future.

Projects: I enjoyed many of the projects I completed in school but have yet to make a personal project. My final project for WDD131 was probably my favorite assignment. I made a website to display and categorise my movie collection.
